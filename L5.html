                <p> 
                    LAP HELL - Pizza Pursuit (formerly known as Lap Hell (Hotfix n' Ready)) is a lapping mod created by TheCyVap.
                    This mod is the upgraded version of the Lap Hell Mod by redvoltron and adds a multitude of additions, along with making previously unlappable levels possible along with adding a new level called The Pizza Gauntlet.
                    The main feature of Lap Hell - Pizza Pursuit is that the mod does not outright change the difficulty of Lap 3 unless necessary, but significantly increases the difficulty on Laps 4 and 5.
